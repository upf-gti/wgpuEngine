MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `In wgpuEngine the class ${ INLINE_CODE( "Scene" ) } is meant to represent a compilation of nodes—a generic container for everything that a scene could have— in a space. 
An ${ INLINE_CODE( "Engine" ) } instance can have as many scenes as you want, and you are responsible for setting and selecting the current scene.` );

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `The ${ INLINE_CODE( "Node" ) } class does not have a lot that you can do with it, however its derived classes are more interesting. 
Here you can see most of the nodes supported in the engine:` );

INSERT_IMAGE( "images/Node_scheme.png", "Node Inheritance Scheme" );

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `A ${ INLINE_CODE( "Node3D" ) } contains a 3D transform that details its position in the scene, so that all the nodes that inherit will have a position transform in the scene. 
However, some nodes might need to overload its transform in runtime, like the ${ INLINE_CODE( "Camera" ) } node in VR mode that will follow the head of the user in the 3D space, or like the ${ INLINE_CODE( "Environment3D" ) } 
that contains a skybox that is always following the camera.` );

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `If it's a ${ INLINE_CODE( "Node2D" ) }, it will contain a size and a relative position inside the 2D container node, that adds a 3D transform and position in the scene to the 2D elements.` );

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `Usually most of the nodes that you are going to use are ${ INLINE_CODE( "MeshInstance" ) } nodes. They contain a ${ INLINE_CODE( "Mesh" ) } (composed of one or more sub-meshes or 
${ INLINE_CODE( "Surfaces" ) } as they are called in the engine), a ${ INLINE_CODE( "Material" ) } (that defines how it is going to be rendered to the screen), and a transform that positions and scales the mesh in the scene.` );

MAKE_HEADER( "Importing scenes", "h2", "importing" );

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `wgpuEngine currently supports 3 formats for importing geometry data: .obj, .gtlf and .glb. Both .gltf and .glb are part of the glTF standard of scene description 
(the only difference is that .gltf is stored in human-readable JSON format, and .glb is in binary format). This scene description format includes mesh geometry, material, and position. 
obj just includes geometry and materials, so we prefer glb as the main import for the engine.

MAKE_PARAGRAPH( `In this snippet, we are loading inside a ${ INLINE_CODE( "Node" ) } pointer array all the nodes inside two GLB files, and they are just putting 2 entities inside the scene.
